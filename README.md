# JavaPE1WithTestCases
It has 10 java programs with test cases

The description of programs is as follows:
1.)  Java program which accepts a number as input and check whether the given number is
     palindrome or not If it is a palindrome then add all the even numbers and check whether the sum is more than 25.
     
2.)  Java program to check if number is between 20 and 30, if it is, then print tom if number is odd
     and print jerry if number is even

3.)  Program that accepts a word as input and checks for each single character letter in
    the word whether it is a consonant or vowel.

4.)  Write a program using a loop to print the following output. 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6
     6 6 . . . nth iteration.
     
5.)  Program that reads an unspecified number of integer arguments using Scanner Class
     and adds them together. The program displays total of the given input number and only
     considers integer value.The program displays an error message if there are any non
     integer values.

6.)  program that takes a character from the user as input and determines whether the
     character entered is a capital letter, a small case letter, a digit or a special symbol and display
     appropriately.

7.)  a program which accepts a number as input from user and perform the following:
     a. sort the number in non-increasing order
     b. after sorting sum all the even numbers, the sum should be greater than 15 .
     c. if sum is more than 15,then print output as true or false.

8.)  a program which accepts a number from user as input (set the limit say 1 - 50 or 1 -
     100) User should guess until the the target number is guessed correctly.

9.)  Java program to reverse any string without using String Buffer.

10.)  Java program for the following condition:
      Given 2 inputs , where input1 is string and input 2 is integer value, the last n characters are
      repeated n number of times in the output String.
